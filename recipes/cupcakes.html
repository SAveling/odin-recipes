  <h1>Vanilla Cupcakes with Buttercream Frosting</h1>
  <img src="../img/cupcake.jpeg" alt="A tasty looking vanilla cupcake">

  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>This is the best vanilla cupcake with vanilla buttercream frosting that i've ever come across; and it's all thanks to Cupcake Jemma. These cupcakes come out moist and flavorful every time.</p>

  <h4>Ingredients (cupcake batter):</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>125g self raising flour</li>
    <li>125g caster sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda</li>
    <li>125g soft, unsalted butter (very soft)</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tbsp milk</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp vanilla extract</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Method:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 170Â°C and line a cupcake/muffin tray with 12 cases.</li>
    <li>In a sieve over the mixing bowl - add the flour, caster sugar and bicarbonate of soda and sift them.</li>
    <li>Add 125g of butter.</li>
    <li>Add 2 large eggs.</li>
    <li>Start the mixer on a low speed until everything is just mixed and then turn up to medium to high for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>With the mixer on a low speed add the milk and vanilla extract.</li>
    <li>Put the mixer back up to medium to high speed for one last blast (about 30 seconds).</li>
    <li>Stop the mixer, remove the paddle and get as much batter off as you can. Scrape the sides with a spatula and give a final mix with the spatula to catch anything missed by the paddle at the bottom.</li>
    <li>Using a dessert spoon and teaspoon scoop the batter into the cupcake cases</li>
    <li>Bake for 22 minutes in the pre-heated oven. Check with a skewer - it should come out clean.</li>
    <li>Leave in tray for 5-10 minutes and then transfer to a wire cooling rack.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Ingredients (frosting):</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>200g very, very soft butter</li>
    <li>450g sifted icing sugar</li>
    <li>2 tbsp milk</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Method:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Add the butter to a mixer and beat for 2-3 minutes on a medium speed.</li>
    <li>The butter should now look very pale (edging on white) and be fluffy.</li>
    <li>Add half the icing sugar to the bowl with the butter and start the mixer on a low speed.</li>
    <li>Once its incorporated turn the mixer up to medium speed and beat for 2-3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the last half of the icing sugar and again start on slow, then once mixed together, increase speed to medium and beat for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Turn down to a low speed and add the milk and vanilla extract.</li>
    <li>Turn back up to a high speed for 1-2 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
